We get the following time of execution of the program for three different number of blocks read by the disk for sRead.c


time ./tRead 10
real	0m0.117s
user	0m0.097s
sys	0m0.007s

time ./tRead 100
real	0m1.087s
user	0m1.005s
sys	0m0.030s

time ./tRead 1000
real	0m10.711s
user	0m9.999s
sys	0m0.314s

Explanation: We can see that there is a linear relationship between the number of blocks and the execution time. The reason is each disk read is synchronous(they are executed one after the other). They take 10ms. Thus we get a linear runtime.
