	8   runs and synchronizes with no deadlock but small problems
	7   deadlocks but code inspection reveals that nearly got synchronization right
	6   basic structure of synchronization correct but several problems
	4   significant errors using synchronization primitives, but still uses them
	3-0 for failure to use synchronization primitives at all or in anywhere near a correct way
NOTEs:
	- Script just checks for correct output
	- So you need to quickly check the use of synchronization primitives
	- Spend 30 to 60 seconds and then put student in one of the buckets above
