The problem is that list_delete_element calls free on list elements even if they are referenced from the tree.  And so, when q3 calls list_delete, the list-element pointers in the tree nodes become dangling pointers.  Subsequently calling tree_order_suffix_print causes the program to following these dangling pointers, but subsequent calls to malloc (in, for example printf) change what is in memory at the location pointed to by the dandling pointers, causing bad things to happen.
