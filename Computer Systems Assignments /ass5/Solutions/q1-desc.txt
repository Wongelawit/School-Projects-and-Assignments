Here's the code:
  v0 = a->x[i];
  v1 = a->b.y[i];
  v2 = a->b.a->x[i];
  a->b.a = a;
  v3 = a->b.a->b.y[i];

Reads:
	i
	a
	a->x
	a->x[i]
	a->b.y[i]
	a->b.a
	a->b.a->x
	a->b.a->x[i]

It is okay if you also list the following read and have a count of 9.  This read is unnecessary if you realize that a->b.a is a and thus a->b.a->b.y[i] is a->b.y[i], which has already been read.
	a->b.a->b.y[i] 

Writes:
	v1, v1, v2, v3, and a->b.a
